## About
This repository was an excerside done in my front-end developer course. Every week we added something new to this, starting from a basic display of the data, to adding forms, models, sorting and third-party dependencies.

It uses an API made by the teacher, which is hosted on Heroku. 
The aim of this course was to learn about using API's, React, front-end development and 3rd party dependencies.

## Future
Host the result. estimated April 2021
Otherwise this repository is done, since i finsihed the course and improvements don't reflect my skills back when i finished the course
